      A homebrew game for the Game Boy. It was an attempt to make a bullet
      hell game, but the source code is quite messy and I hate gbdk so I don't
      maintain the game anymore.<br>
      <a href="https://gitlab.com/nanom_/rogen/-/raw/main/build/rogen.gb">
        Download the ROM here
      </a>
      or
      <a href="https://gitlab.com/nanom_/rogen">get the source code</a>.<br>
      Enjoy :3

    <dt>W-7 Minecraft Server</dt>
    <dd>
      It was a Minecraft Server I maintained for a month or so. I created it
      to play with the users of some imageboard that I don't
      visit anymore. You can get the server files
      <a href="https://cloud.operationtulip.com/s/TdJyWLaC2oQBt8q">here</a>.

      it's a really crappy python script I wrote to manage my old blog.
      I don't maintain it anymore and it's not available on my GitLab repos.
      I don't recommend using it but if you still want it contact me via
      Matrix or shoot me an email.

    <dt>Femto.css</dt>
    <dd>
      A CSS framework. It was more of an experiment than anything else.

    <dt>Old and crappy Game Maker games</dt>
    <dd>
      I made some weird games in the Game Maker engine
      when I was a dumb 11-12 year old. They're really crappy of course, but
      I might release their source code in the future just because why not.
      Just be patient and soon you'll be able to cringe hard reading my old
      games' source code.
