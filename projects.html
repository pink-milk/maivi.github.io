    <!--<dt>Discord Stock bot</dt>
    <dd>
      A discord bot that I made with my friends during the GameStop freak out. 
      It reports back live prices, quarter prices, and *a bunch* of other relevant data of tickers.

      or

    <dt>Old and crappy Dating simulators</dt>
    <dd>
      I made some weird games in the Renpy engine
      when I was an angsty 15 year old. They're really crappy of course, but
      I might release their source code in the future just because why not.
      Just be patient and soon you'll be able to cringe hard reading my old
      games' source code.
