  <h1>about me</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>
    Hi. My name is Olivia (or MaiVi) and I'm a 20 year old "programmer" trying to relive the glory days of the late 90s early 2000s. I spend my time browsing
    the internet, writing bad programs, and running till my legs fall off. 
    Right now I'm a junior C.S. kid at George Mason University :)
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm still trying to figure out what I like doing, so I try to participate in many cool projects/events near me. 
    So far I know I like linux and python's game dev libraries, and am somewhat suspicious of data analytics.
  </p>

    If you want to ask something or just talk use
    Discord (carl#9599) or

    to keep in touch.
  </p>

  <p>
    Take care~ &lt;3 <img src="/spin.gif" alt="uwu" class="noborder">
