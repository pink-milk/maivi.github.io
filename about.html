  <h1>about me</h1>
  <hr>
  <p>
    Hi. I'm a 18 year old "programmer" and social recluse. I spend my time browsing
    the internet, writing programs and sleeping.
  </p>
  <p>
    I like programming, game development, linux and FOSS things. I used to have
    a blog full of musings and rants about things I don't like but it's
    now hidden. Maybe I will make a new blog later.
  </p>
  <p>
    I speak English and Spanish so please use one of those to talk to me.
  </p>
  <p>
    If you want to ask something or just talk use
    <a href="xmpp:nanom@riseup.net">XMPP</a> or
    <a href="https://matrix.to/#/@nanom:matrix.org">Matrix</a>
    to keep in touch.
    Alternatively you can send me an email, but I don't read emails often.
    <a href="pubkey.txt">Here's my gpg key</a>.
  </p>
  <p>
    I'm not a cyberpunk, free software or linux advocate. I'm just nerdy enough to
    like those things.
  </p>
  <p>
    Take care~ &lt;3 <img src="img/spin.gif" alt="uwu" class="noborder">
